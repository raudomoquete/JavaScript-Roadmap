<!-- An operand – is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is 2. 
    Sometimes, people call these “arguments” instead of “operands”.

    An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number: -->

    <script>
     /*    let x = 1;

        x = -x;
        alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied */

       // An operator is binary if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well:
       let x = 1, y = 3;
       alert( y - x ); // 2, binary minus subtracts values

       // Maths
        /*  The following math operations are supported:

            Addition +,
            Subtraction -,
            Multiplication *,
            Division /,
            Remainder %,
            Exponentiation **. 
        */

        // The first four are straightforward, while % and ** need a few words about them:
       // Remainder %
        /* The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.

        The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.

        For instance: */
        alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2
        alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3
        alert( 8 % 4 ); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4

        // Exponentiation **
        /*    The exponentiation operator a ** b raises a to the power of b.

            In school maths, we write that as ab.

            For instance: */
            alert( 2 ** 2 ); // 2² = 4
            alert( 2 ** 3 ); // 2³ = 8
            alert( 2 ** 4 ); // 2⁴ = 16

            // Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.

            // For example, a square root is an exponentiation by ½:

            alert( 4 ** (1/2) ); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
            alert( 8 ** (1/3) ); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)
