<!-- The “if” statement
The if(...) statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is true, executes a block of code. -->

<!-- For example: -->
<script>
    let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');
    if (year == 2015) alert( 'You are right!' );

/* In the example above, the condition is a simple equality check (year == 2015), but it can be much more complex.

If we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces: */

if (year == 2015) {
    alert( "That's correct!" );
    alert( "You're so smart!" );
}
</script>
