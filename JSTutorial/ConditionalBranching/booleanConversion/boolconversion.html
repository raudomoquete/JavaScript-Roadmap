/*     Boolean conversion
The if (…) statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.

Let’s recall the conversion rules from the chapter Type Conversions:

A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false. Because of that they are called “falsy” values.
Other values become true, so they are called “truthy”.
So, the code under this condition would never execute: */

if (0) { // 0 is falsy
    
}

// …and inside this condition – it always will:
if (1) { // 1 is truthy

}

// We can also pass a pre-evaluated boolean value to if, like this:
let cond = (year == 2015); // equality evaluates to true or false

if (cond){
    
}
