    // String comparison
   /*  To see whether a string is greater than another, JavaScript uses the so-called “dictionary” or “lexicographical” order.

    In other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter.

 /*    The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:

    Compare the first character of both strings.
    If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string’s, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We’re done.
    Otherwise, if both strings’ first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same way.
    Repeat until the end of either string.
    If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is greater.
    In the first example above, the comparison 'Z' > 'A' gets to a result at the first step.

    The second comparison 'Glow' and 'Glee' needs more steps as strings are compared character-by-character:

    G is the same as G.
    l is the same as l.
    o is greater than e. Stop here. The first string is greater. */

    // Comparison of different types
    alert( '2' > 1 ); // true, string '2' becomes a number 2
    alert( '01' == 1 ); // true, string '01' becomes a number 1

    /* For boolean values, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.

    For example: */

/*     It is possible that at the same time:

    Two values are equal.
    One of them is true as a boolean and the other one is false as a boolean.
    For example: */

    alert( true == 1 ); // true
    alert( false == 0 ); // true

    let a = 0;
    alert( Boolean(a) ); // false

    let b = "0";
    alert( Boolean(b) ); // true

    alert(a == b);
